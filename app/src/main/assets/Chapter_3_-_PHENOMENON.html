<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fog veiling my window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn&#39;t the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid - coating the needles on the trees in fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn&#39;t the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I shouldn&#39;t be at all anxious to see him today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, today was going to be nightmarish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike&#39;s puppy dog behavior and Eric&#39;s apparent rivalry with him were disconcerting. I wasn&#39;t sure if I didn&#39;t prefer being ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I&#39;d had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of the truck - carefully holding the side for support - to examine my tires. There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn&#39;t used to being taken care of, and Charlie&#39;s unspoken concern caught me by surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detail several things at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn&#39;t even have time to close my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I&#39;d parked next to. But I didn&#39;t have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van&#39;s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll&#39;s, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt - exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen&#39;s low, frantic voice in my ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella? Are you all right?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Be careful,&quot; he warned as I struggled. &quot;I think you hit your head pretty hard.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Ow,&quot; I said, surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;That&#39;s what I thought.&quot; His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;How in the...&quot; I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. &quot;How did you get over here so fast?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I was standing right next to you, Bella,&quot; he said, his tone serious again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as he could in the limited space. I looked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other, shouting at us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; someone instructed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Get Tyler out of the van!&quot; someone else shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward&#39;s cold hand pushed my shoulder down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Just stay put for now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;But it&#39;s cold,&quot; I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You were over there,&quot; I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stopped short. &quot;You were by your car.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">His expression turned hard. &quot;No, I wasn&#39;t.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I saw you.&quot; All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he was going to admit it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way.&quot; He unleashed the full, devastating power of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No.&quot; I set my jaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The gold in his eyes blazed. &quot;Please, Bella.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Why?&quot; I demanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Trust me,&quot; he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I could hear the sirens now. &quot;Will you promise to explain everything to me later?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Fine,&quot; he snapped, abruptly exasperated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Fine,&quot; I repeated angrily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It took six EMTs and two teachers - Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp - to shift the van far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor told them I&#39;d hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella!&quot; he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m completely fine, Char - Dad,&quot; I sighed. &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in my head. When they&#39;d lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dent in the tan car&#39;s bumper - a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward&#39;s shoulders... as if he had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother&#39;s safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen - a solution that excluded the assumption that I was insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under his own power. I ground my teeth together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">separated by pastel-patterned curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn&#39;t obligated to wear the stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head. Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m fine, Tyler - you look awful, are you all right?&quot; As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He ignored me. &quot;I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong...&quot; He winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it; you missed me.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Umm... Edward pulled me out of the way.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He looked confused. &quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Edward Cullen - he was standing next to me.&quot; I&#39;d always been a terrible liar; I didn&#39;t sound convincing at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Cullen? I didn&#39;t see him... wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I think so. He&#39;s here somewhere, but they didn&#39;t make him use a stretcher.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I knew I wasn&#39;t crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I&#39;d seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler&#39;s constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No matter how many times I tried to convince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Is she sleeping?&quot; a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. It wasn&#39;t easy - it would have been more natural to ogle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Hey, Edward, I&#39;m really sorry -&quot; Tyler began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Edward lifted a hand to stop him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No blood, no foul,&quot; he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler&#39;s bed, facing me. He smirked again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So, what&#39;s the verdict?&quot; he asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with me at all, but they won&#39;t let me go,&quot; I complained. &quot;How come you aren&#39;t strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s all about who you know,&quot; he answered. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, I came to spring you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">young, he was blond... and he was handsomer than any movie star I&#39;d ever seen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles under his eyes. From Charlie&#39;s description, this had to be Edward&#39;s father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So, Miss Swan,&quot; Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, &quot;how are you feeling?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; I said, for the last time, I hoped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Your X-rays look good,&quot; he said. &quot;Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The doctor&#39;s cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Tender?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Not really.&quot; I&#39;d had worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward&#39;s patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Well, your father is in the waiting room - you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Can&#39;t I go back to school?&quot; I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Maybe you should take it easy today.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I glanced at Edward. &quot;Does he get to go to school?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,&quot; Edward said smugly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Actually,&quot; Dr. Cullen corrected, &quot;most of the school seems to be in the waiting room.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Oh no,&quot; I moaned, covering my face with my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. &quot;Do you want to stay?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No, no!&quot; I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly - I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Take some Tylenol for the pain,&quot; he suggested as he steadied me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt that bad,&quot; I insisted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It sounds like you were extremely lucky,&quot; Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,&quot; I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Oh, well, yes,&quot; Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m afraid that you&#39;ll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,&quot; he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">As soon as the doctor&#39;s back was turned, I moved to Edward&#39;s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Can I talk to you for a minute?&quot; I hissed under my breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Your father is waiting for you,&quot; he said through his teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;d like to speak with you alone, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; I pressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into a short hallway, he spun around to face me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;What do you want?&quot; he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I&#39;d intended. &quot;You owe me an explanation,&quot; I reminded him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I saved your life - I don&#39;t owe you anything.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. &quot;You promised.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella, you hit your head, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; His tone was cutting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with my head.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He glared back. &quot;What do you want from me, Bella?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I want to know the truth,&quot; I said. &quot;I want to know why I&#39;m lying for you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;What do you think happened?&quot; he snapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It came out in a rush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;All I know is that you weren&#39;t anywhere near me - Tyler didn&#39;t see you, either, so don&#39;t tell me I hit my head too hard. That van was going to crush us both - and it didn&#39;t, and your hands left dents in the side of it - and you left a dent in the other car, and you&#39;re not hurt at all - and the van should have smashed my legs, but you were holding it up...&quot; I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn&#39;t continue. I was so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You think I lifted a van off you?&quot; His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I merely nodded once, jaw tight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Nobody will believe that, you know.&quot; His voice held an edge of derision now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m not going to tell anybody.&quot; I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Surprise flitted across his face. &quot;Then why does it matter?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It matters to me,&quot; I insisted. &quot;I don&#39;t like to lie - so there&#39;d better be a good reason why I&#39;m doing it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Can&#39;t you just thank me and get over it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Thank you.&quot; I waited, fuming and expectant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You&#39;re not going to let it go, are you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;In that case... I hope you enjoy disappointment.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in danger of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Why did you even bother?&quot; I asked frigidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">And then he turned his back on me and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The waiting room was more unpleasant than I&#39;d feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with me,&quot; I assured him sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for chitchat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;What did the doctor say?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home.&quot; I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric were all there, beginning to converge on us. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; I urged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn&#39;t need to worry anymore. It was a huge relief- the first time I&#39;d ever felt that way - to get into the cruiser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward&#39;s defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could hardly believe I&#39;d witnessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Um... you&#39;ll need to call Ren&uml;&brvbar;e.&quot; He hung his head, guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was appalled. &quot;You told Mom!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Sorry.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I slammed the cruiser&#39;s door a little harder than necessary on my way out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home - forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment - but her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn&#39;t as eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.</span></p>
