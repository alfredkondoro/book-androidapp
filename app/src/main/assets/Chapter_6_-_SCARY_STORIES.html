<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">As I sat in my room, trying to concentrate on the third act of Macbeth, I was really listening for my truck. I would have thought, even over the pounding rain, I could have heard the engine&#39;s roar. But when I went to peek out the curtain - again - it was suddenly there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I wasn&#39;t looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there were the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had kept his mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward&#39;s involvement. She</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">did have a lot of questions about lunch, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday?&quot; Jessica asked in Trig.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I answered truthfully. &quot;He never really got to the point.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You looked kind of mad,&quot; she fished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Did I?&quot; I kept my expression blank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You know, I&#39;ve never seen him sit with anyone but his family before. That was weird.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Weird,&quot; I agreed. She seemed annoyed; she flipped her dark curls impatiently - I guessed she&#39;d been hoping to hear something that would make a good story for her to pass on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he wasn&#39;t going to be there, I still hoped. When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I couldn&#39;t keep from looking at his table, where Rosalie, Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together. And I couldn&#39;t stop the gloom that engulfed me as I realized I didn&#39;t know how long I would have to wait before I saw him again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for the next day. Mike was animated again, putting a great deal of trust in the local weatherman who promised sun tomorrow. I&#39;d have to see that before I believed it. But it was warmer today - almost sixty. Maybe the outing wouldn&#39;t be completely miserable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren during lunch, which I didn&#39;t understand until we were all walking out of the room together. I was right behind her, just a foot from her slick, silver blond hair, and she was evidently unaware of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;...don&#39;t know why Bella&quot; - she sneered my name - &quot;doesn&#39;t just sit with the Cullens from now on.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I heard her muttering to Mike. I&#39;d never noticed what an unpleasant, nasal voice she had, and I was surprised by the malice in it. I really didn&#39;t know her well at all, certainly not well enough for her to dislike me - or so I&#39;d thought. &quot;She&#39;s my friend; she sits with us,&quot; Mike whispered back loyally, but also a bit territorially. I paused to let Jess and Angela pass me. I didn&#39;t want to hear any more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he felt guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends, but he&#39;d spent too many years building his habits to break them now. Of course he knew the names of all the kids going, and their parents, and their great-grandparents, too, probably. He seemed to approve. I wondered if he would approve of my plan to ride to Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or something like that? I think it&#39;s south of Mount Rainier,&quot; I asked casually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Yeah - why?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I shrugged. &quot;Some kids were talking about camping there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s not a very good place for camping.&quot; He sounded surprised. &quot;Too many bears. Most people go there during the hunting season.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Oh,&quot; I murmured. &quot;Maybe I got the name wrong.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke me. I opened my eyes to see a clear yellow light streaming through my window. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I hurried to the window to check, and sure enough, there was the sun. It was in the wrong place in the sky, too low, and it didn&#39;t seem to be as close as it should be, but it was definitely the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Clouds ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was visible in the middle. I lingered by the window as long as I could, afraid that if I left the blue would disappear again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Newtons&#39; Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I&#39;d seen the store, but I&#39;d never stopped there - not having much need for any supplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of time. In the parking lot I recognized Mike&#39;s Suburban and Tyler&#39;s Sentra. As I pulled up next to their vehicles, I could see the group standing around in front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two other boys I had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess was there, flanked by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including one I remembered falling over in Gym on Friday. That one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something to Lauren. Lauren shook out her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">So it was going to be one of those days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">At least Mike was happy to see me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You came!&quot; he called, delighted. &quot;And I said it would be sunny today, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I told you I was coming,&quot; I reminded him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;We&#39;re just waiting for Lee and Samantha... unless you invited someone,&quot; Mike added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Nope,&quot; I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn&#39;t get caught in the lie. But also wishing that a miracle would occur, and Edward would appear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mike looked satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Will you ride in my car? It&#39;s that or Lee&#39;s mom&#39;s minivan.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Sure.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You can have shotgun,&quot; he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn&#39;t as simple to make Mike and Jessica happy at the same time. I could see Jessica glowering at us now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in between Mike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike could have been more graceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, dense green forests edging the road most of the way and the wide Quillayute River snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. We&#39;d rolled the windows down - the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with nine people in it - and I tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I&#39;d been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summers with Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only a thin border of actual sand at the water&#39;s edge, after which it grew into millions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had a teepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?&quot; Mike asked me. I was sitting on one of the bone-colored benches; the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting one of the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No,&quot; I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You&#39;ll like this then - watch the colors.&quot; He lit another small branch and laid it alongside the first. The flames started to lick quickly up the dry wood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s blue,&quot; I said in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;The salt does it. Pretty, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn&#39;t yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his attention. I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of the only things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On the other hand, I&#39;d also fallen into them a lot. Not a big deal when you&#39;re seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward&#39;s request - that I not fall into the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn&#39;t want to hike, and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before I got up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smile when he saw that I was coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The hike wasn&#39;t too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light banter around me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke through the emerald confines of the forest and found the rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely drained were teeming with life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of the largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I was completely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wondered what Edward was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would be saying if he were here with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. I tried to keep up better this time through the woods, so naturally I fell a few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees of my jeans were stained green, but it could have been worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">When we got back to First Beach, the group we&#39;d left behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could see the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">come to socialize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him. All I caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person to be around - she didn&#39;t feel the need to fill every silence with chatter. She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur at times, with single images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind. I knew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike - with Jessica shadowing him - headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went with them; others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes were dark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just a hint of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether, a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by the first words out of his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You&#39;re Isabella Swan, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was like the first day of school all over again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella,&quot; I sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m Jacob Black.&quot; He held his hand out in a friendly gesture. &quot;You bought my dad&#39;s truck.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. &quot;You&#39;re Billy&#39;s son. I probably should remember you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No, I&#39;m the youngest of the family - you would remember my older sisters.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Rachel and Rebecca,&quot; I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrown us together a lot during my visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course, I&#39;d kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Are they here?&quot; I examined the girls at the ocean&#39;s edge, wondering if I would recognize them now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No.&quot; Jacob shook his head. &quot;Rachel got a scholarship to Washington State, and Rebecca married a Samoan surfer - she lives in Hawaii now.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Married. Wow.&quot; I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a year older than I was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So how do you like the truck?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I love it. It runs great.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s really slow,&quot; he laughed. &quot;I was so relived when Charlie bought it. My dad wouldn&#39;t let me work on building another car when we had a perfectly good vehicle right there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It&#39;s not that slow,&quot; I objected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Have you tried to go over sixty?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No,&quot; I admitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Good. Don&#39;t.&quot; He grinned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I couldn&#39;t help grinning back. &quot;It does great in a collision,&quot; I offered in my truck&#39;s defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I don&#39;t think a tank could take out that old monster,&quot; he agreed with another laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So you build cars?&quot; I asked, impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn&#39;t happen to know where I could get my hands on a master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit?&quot; he added jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Sorry,&quot; I laughed, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen any lately, but I&#39;ll keep my eyes open for you.&quot; As if I knew what that was. He was very easy to talk with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I was learning to recognize. I wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You know Bella, Jacob?&quot; Lauren asked - in what I imagined was an insolent tone - from across the fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;We&#39;ve sort of known each other since I was born,&quot; he laughed, smiling at me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;How nice.&quot; She didn&#39;t sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Bella,&quot; she called again, watching my face carefully, &quot;I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn&#39;t anyone think to invite them?&quot; Her expression of concern was unconvincing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen&#39;s family?&quot; the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren&#39;s irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Yes, do you know them?&quot; she asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;The Cullens don&#39;t come here,&quot; he said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren&#39;s opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He&#39;d said that the Cullens didn&#39;t come here, but his tone had implied something more - that they weren&#39;t allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it without success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jacob interrupted my meditation. &quot;So is Forks driving you insane yet?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Oh, I&#39;d say that&#39;s an understatement.&quot; I grimaced. He grinned understandingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had a sudden inspiration. It was a stupid plan, but I didn&#39;t have any better ideas. I hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls, so that he wouldn&#39;t see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Do you want to walk down the beach with me?&quot; I asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of looking up from underneath his eyelashes. It couldn&#39;t have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob jumped up willingly enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So you&#39;re, what, sixteen?&quot; I asked, trying not to look like an idiot as I fluttered my eyelids the way I&#39;d seen girls do on TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I just turned fifteen,&quot; he confessed, flattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Really?&quot; My face was full of false surprise. &quot;I would have thought you were older.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;m tall for my age,&quot; he explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Do you come up to Forks much?&quot; I asked archly, as if I was hoping for a yes. I sounded idiotic to myself. I was afraid he would turn on me with disgust and accuse me of my fraud, but he still seemed flattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Not too much,&quot; he admitted with a frown. &quot;But when I get my car finished I can go up as much as I want - after I get my license,&quot; he amended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He seemed a little old to be hanging out with us.&quot; I purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters, trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;That&#39;s Sam - he&#39;s nineteen,&quot; he informed me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;What was that he was saying about the doctor&#39;s family?&quot; I asked innocently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;The Cullens? Oh, they&#39;re not supposed to come onto the reservation.&quot; He looked away, out toward James Island, as he confirmed what I&#39;d thought I&#39;d heard in Sam&#39;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He glanced back at me, biting his lip. &quot;Oops. I&#39;m not supposed to say anything about that.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Oh, I won&#39;t tell anyone, I&#39;m just curious.&quot; I tried to make my smile alluring, wondering if I was laying it on too thick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he lifted one eyebrow and his voice was even huskier than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Do you like scary stories?&quot; he asked ominously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I love them,&quot; I enthused, making an effort to smolder at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that had its roots sticking out like the attenuated legs of a huge, pale spider. He perched lightly on one of the twisted roots while I sat beneath him on the body of the tree. He stared down at the rocks, a smile hovering around the edges of his broad lips. I could see he was going to try to make this good. I focused on keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from - the Quileutes, I mean?&quot; he began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Not really,&quot; I admitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood - supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and the ark.&quot; He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. &quot;Another legend claims that we descended from wolves - and that the wolves are our brothers still. It&#39;s against tribal law to kill them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Then there are the stories about the cold ones.&quot; His voice dropped a little lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;The cold ones?&quot; I asked, not faking my intrigue now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land.&quot; He rolled his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Your great-grandfather?&quot; I encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf-well, not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Werewolves have enemies?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Only one.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I stared at him earnestly, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So you see,&quot; Jacob continued, &quot;the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to our territory during my great-grandfather&#39;s time was different. They didn&#39;t hunt the way others of their kind did - they weren&#39;t supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn&#39;t expose them to the pale-faces.&quot; He winked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;If they weren&#39;t dangerous, then why... ?&quot; I tried to understand, struggling not to let him see how seriously I was considering his ghost story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;There&#39;s always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they&#39;re civilized like this clan was. You never know when they might get too hungry to resist.&quot; He deliberately worked a thick edge of menace into his tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;What do you mean, &#39;civilized&#39;?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;They claimed that they didn&#39;t hunt humans. They supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals instead.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I tried to keep my voice casual. &quot;So how does it fit in with the Cullens? Are they like the cold ones your greatgrandfather met?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No.&quot; He paused dramatically. &quot;They are the same ones.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by his story. He smiled, pleased, and continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;There are more of them now, a new female and a new male, but the rest are the same. In my great-grandfather&#39;s time they already knew of the leader, Carlisle. He&#39;d been here and gone before your people had even arrived.&quot; He was fighting a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;And what are they?&quot; I finally asked. &quot;What are the cold ones?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">He smiled darkly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Blood drinkers,&quot; he replied in a chilling voice. &quot;Your people call them vampires.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not sure what my face</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">was exposing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You have goose bumps,&quot; he laughed delightedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You&#39;re a good storyteller,&quot; I complimented him, still staring into the waves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn&#39;t it? No wonder my dad doesn&#39;t want us to talk about it to anyone.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I couldn&#39;t control my expression enough to look at him yet. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t give you away.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I guess I just violated the treaty,&quot; he laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I&#39;ll take it to the grave,&quot; I promised, and then I shivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Seriously, though, don&#39;t say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad at my dad when he heard that some of us weren&#39;t going to the hospital since Dr. Cullen started working there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;I won&#39;t, of course not.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So do you think we&#39;re a bunch of superstitious natives or what?&quot; he asked in a playful tone, but with a hint of worry. I still hadn&#39;t looked away from the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No. I think you&#39;re very good at telling scary stories, though. I still have goose bumps, see?&quot; I held up my arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Cool.&quot; He smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each other warned us that someone was approaching. Our heads snapped up at the same time to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, walking toward us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;There you are, Bella,&quot; Mike called in relief, waving his arm over his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Is that your boyfriend?&quot; Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge in Mike&#39;s voice. I was surprised it was so obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;No, definitely not,&quot; I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob, and eager to make him as happy as possible. I winked at him, carefully turning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;So when I get my license...&quot; he began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime.&quot; I felt guilty as I said this, knowing that I&#39;d used him. But I really did like Jacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could see his eyes appraising Jacob, and looking satisfied at his obvious youth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Where have you been?&quot; he asked, though the answer was right in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Jacob was just telling me some local stories,&quot; I volunteered. &quot;It was really interesting.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Well,&quot; Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watched our camaraderie. &quot;We&#39;re packing up - it looks like it&#39;s going to rain soon.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;Okay.&quot; I jumped up. &quot;I&#39;m coming.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It was nice to see you again,&quot; Jacob said, and I could tell he was taunting Mike just a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I&#39;ll come, too,&quot; I promised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">His grin stretched across his face. &quot;That would be cool.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">&quot;And thanks,&quot; I added earnestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;">I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parking lot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stones where they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were already loading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela and Tyler, announcing that I&#39;d already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler&#39;s attention, so I could simply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hard not to think.</span></p>
